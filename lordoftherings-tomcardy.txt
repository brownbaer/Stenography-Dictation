The Lord of the Rings - by Tom Cardy https://youtu.be/DgMnCLHQuqc

I think I speak for everyone here when I say it is very exciting to be in a room with you Mr. Tolkein.
Okay.
We loved publishing the Hobbit, can you tell us a bit about this next book?
It's about a magic ring,
Yeah.
Given to an heir,
Yeah.
Who must destroy all evil,
Yeah.
On a magic quest.
What happens next?
They walk walk walk walk walk walk somebody's following them walk walk hide walk walk walk steal some mushrooms.
Get on a boat walk walk walk elves for the first time wow walk walk nighttime walk walk walk attacked by trees.
Okay, um. That's a lot of walking.
I'm not a third of the way through!
Walk walk meet a weird bush guy walk walk finally a town safe safe eat rest show every one their secret get the fuck out of there run run they got a new tall guy run scared stab a dementor ride run run ride dementors can't swim fuck back to Azkaban.
Okay well, that seems like a good place to end it we'll publish it.
I'm almost half way rest rest a bunch of elves they've seen elves before but now they've got a dwarf walk walk heaps of walking path is blocked walk underground orc run walk run a Balrog has come. 
Kick him in the ass!
You shall not fuck with me!
Walk walk I'm sick of elves get on a boat bottom is an asshole.
Mother fuckers on a magic quest fellows in the fellowship doing what they do best.
What if for a while they rode a massive hawk? 
I think I'd preferred if they walk!
This is my book mother fucker they'll walk if I tell them to. Get that weak ass bird shit out of here.
